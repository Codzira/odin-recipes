    <h1>Nacho Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./img/Nachos.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a basic nacho recipe passed down from my great great abuelita. It reminds me when I was a kid coming home
        to the smell of refried beans from a can and corn tortilla chips fresh from the Kroger branded bag. Mixed with some
        sour cream and some cheese, and you got yourself one heck of a nachos night.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Refried Beans</li>
        <li>Kroger branded chips</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Here's how to make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a can of refried beans. It should have the consistency of wet dog food.</li>
        <li>Heat them up in a microwaveable bowl that will be too hot to touch while keeping the beans cold</li>
        <li>Open a bag of Kroger branded chips and pour them into an oversized plate</li>
        <li>Remove beans from bowl and slosh onto chips</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese on top and place in microwave long enough to make the cheese burn onto the chips</li>
        <li>Remove and add desired amount of sour cream (for flavor)</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
